## Suggestion
The Product Comparison table led me to suggest **GitLab CI**. It offers a smooth fit with the existing specifications.

The process of integrating natively with the current workflow GitLab CI offers a "unified DevOps platform" experience because our team already uses **GitLab.com** for private source code repositories. It removes "tool sprawl" by integrating security scanning, CI/CD pipelines, and repository management into a single interface.
**Enhanced Protection for Private Information:** High-level security is necessary for sensitive Python apps and credit card transactions, according to the backend team. With its **"security built-in, not bolted on,"** design, GitLab offers automated SAST, DAST, dependency, and container scanning that seamlessly integrates with the pipelines. Compared to conventional techniques, it claims a **50% faster vulnerability detection** and a **13x faster security scanning** rate.
