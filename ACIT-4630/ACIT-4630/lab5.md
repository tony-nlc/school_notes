1.  CBC referring cipher block chaining.
128 is the bit length there are 32 hex which 128 bits and 16 bytes
AES is the **cipher** or the mathematical algorithm used to scramble the data. It is a "symmetric" encryption standard, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

3. 
No, the keyz provided is not part of a key pair. The algorithm used, AES-128-cbc, is a symmetric-key algorithm.
4. No as it is a symmetric way of ciphering. Once ppl has that specific key and IV they can decrypt your data
